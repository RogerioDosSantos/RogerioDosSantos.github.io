It is amazing the amount of information that we have in our hands though the Internet. Information can bring us knowledge and knowledge can empower people, therefore never in the history of the humanity we have such equal opportunities are we are having now.

If we think that a person with a simple smart phone has more access to information that the US president Ronald Reagan had in the eighties when handling the cold war we can understand how technology can change our lives.

Below is an image of what happens on the Internet each minute. For sure when I go back to this post in five years from now I will think... This is nothing...
