Automatically create/update a Web Site or Blog using Evernote

<hr>

### What it is Postach.io

Postach.io is an amazing tool that allow you to publish a WebSite using your Evernote notes. This post for example uses the Postach.io website and it was completely described using Evernote.

### How It Works

Postach.io creates blog posts and pages from your notes. To create a post, write a note and tag it as "published" in a notebook from your choice that you link with your Postach.io site. Once Evernote syncs your note, your note is published on your site, automatically!

Creating a page works the same, except you add an additional tag "page". This tells Postach.io to create your note as page instead of a post.

Every time you change your note and the note get synchronized, your website content will be changed automatically.

To remove a note from your site, simply remove the "published" tag and re-sync. You could also delete the note itself. It is that easy!

### Formating your post

You can format your post using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown "Markdown web site") or using HTML code directly.

Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

You can also format using the Evernote editor itself. Every time your note has a link for example, it will also appear as a link on your publication as well.

### Comments

Postach.io uses [Disqus](http://www.disqus.com "Disqus web site") for comments. Its a widely used and an excellent tool for adding threaded comments to your site quickly. You'll need to create an account, which is free, to start using it.

I first heard about Postach.io on the John Saddington blogs (link above) and I thought I should provide him the credits.
