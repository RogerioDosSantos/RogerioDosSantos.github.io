You can use MathJax on your Postach.io website as the example below:

When $$a != 0$$, there are two solutions to $$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$ and they are:

$$
x = (-b +- sqrt(b^2-4ac))/(2a)
$$

Another example:

When $$x < y$$ or $$x > y$$ or $$x^2$$ or $$a_(m n)$$ or $$a_{m n}$$ or $$(x+1)/y$$ or $$sqrtx$$ we will have the following result:

$$y = alpha + (delta / (Delta*gamma)) +  int(grad lambda) - ((dely) / (delt))$$

The examples above has the following code:
